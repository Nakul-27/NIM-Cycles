# NIM
## An implementation for finding a NIM Cycle in Rust given any subtraction sequence
## Started in Rust and then Shifted to Python.

## QUICKSTART
```console
$ rustc nim.rs
$ ./nim
$ python3 basic.py
```
## Conjecture
Given the subtraction set {a,b,c} where c = a + b, the cycle length is equal to c + a.

## Background of 2-Player 1 String NIM
Nim is a combinarotial two-player game in which each player alternates turns removing any number of tokens from one of possibly many piles.
