# NIM Cycles
## An implementation for finding a NIM Cycle in Python given any subtraction sequence

## QUICKSTART
```console
$ python3 basic.py
```
## Conjectures Given the Subtraction Set {a,b,c}
1. ~~Given c = a + b, then Cl = c + a.~~

2. ~~Given c = 2b, and b = 3, then Cl = 9.~~

3. ~~Given that safe combinations are being generated, if c = 2b and Cl = 12, then the next Cl = 15.~~

4. ~~Given c = 2b, and b = 5, then Cl = 15.~~

5. ~~Given c = 2b, and a > 10 and b = 5, then Cl = 15 + (a - 10).~~

6. ~~If c = b^2 and a is even and b = 2, then Cl = 6.~~

7. If c = b^2 and a is odd and b = 1, then Cl = 2
