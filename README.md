# NIM Cycles
## An implementation for finding a NIM Cycle in Python given any subtraction sequence

## QUICKSTART
```console
$ python3 basic.py
```
## Conjectures Given the Subtraction Set {a,b,c}
~~1. Given c = a + b, the cycle length is equal to c + a.~~

~~2. Given c = b + b, and b = 3, then the Cycle Length is 9.~~

~~3. Given c = b + b, and b = 5, then the cycle length is 15~~

~~4. Given c = b + b, and a > 10 and b = 5, then the cycle length is 15 + (a - 10).~~

## Background of 2-Player 1 String NIM
Nim is a combinarotial two-player game in which each player alternates turns removing any number of tokens from one of possibly many piles.
